# Backlog simulator

Simulate pairs and solo developers working on a backlog.
Pairs complete stories immediately through live code review, while
solo developers must send code through a PR and revision process.
Pairs are also able to review code written by solo developers.

## Run

Run the simulation with

```shell
go run cmd/simulator/simulator.go
```
